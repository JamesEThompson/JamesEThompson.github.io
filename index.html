								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Headshot wHAt.JPG" alt="" /></span>
								<p>My name is James Thompson and a student at the University of Central Florida. I am 19 years old and graduated from Satellite High School high with a General Associates degree from Eastern Florida College. I have always been interested in electronics and everything electrical. This is why I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering as well as wanting to get a Master's degree in the same field.</p>
								<p> Currently I am a junior in college with classes in, Linear Circuits 2, Physics 3, Electromagnetic Fields, and Fundamentals of Electrical Power Systems. The classes Are quite difficult but The information and experience from these classes will help me greatly in my career. I am a very adaptable person and I Like working. Although being adaptable is a good trait I pride myself on my problem-solving ability by addressing problems and solving them in a fast and efficient.

								<p>My For work experience I have yet had the opportunity to prove myself in my field. I have though had a job at the <a href="https://www.egyachtclub.com/"> Eau Gallie Yacht Club</a> with multiple responsibilities. I was a pool lifeguard, summer camp lead counselor, and lead boat driver, and also worked inside the establishment as an all-around helping hand. This professional environment had multiple responsibilities that allowed me to test my worth and ethics and show my dedication. I always acted professional in my environment and I got along with all of my coworkers. According to my manager and coworkers, I helped the working environment be "brighter" and "more exciting to work in". I pride myself in being a very social and talkative person.
								<p>Volunteer work done so far consists of volunteering for the Brevard Zoo to help research about helping the lagoon close by, while holding responsibility and taking observations of oysters. This was my main way or volunteering in highschool but I will do more volunteer work in the near future. A volunteering experience recently has been my volunteering at an airshow Lockheed Martin had at the Orlando Stanford airport. I gave my help with this event for the two days it was near Orlando.</p>
